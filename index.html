      <p>I am just a girl who loves reading books and talking. I have created this website to allow space for me to share my recommendations and talk about the things I love to do.</p>

      <h4 class="book-recs">Book Recommendations</h4>
      <p class="book-recs">I love yapping about books, so you can look forward to book reviews and recommendations of every book I read!</p>
      <h4 class="anti-recs">Book Anti-Recommendations</h4>
      <p class="anti-recs">With every good book, there must be one that really and truly sucks. I mean, how did they even make it through the editing phase kind of suck. You will be hearing about them too.</p>
      <h4>Other Hobbies</h4> 
      <p>I am a woman of many interests! This is a one stop shop of everything that I enjoy, a project to encapulate all of the things I have ever done that I thought was good enough to chat about.</p>

          <p class="description">For generations, the Kalotay family has guarded a collection of ancient and rare books. Esther has fled to a remote base in Antarctica to escape the fate that killed her own mother, and Joanna's isolated herself in their family home in Vermont, devoting her life to the study of these cherished volumes. But after their father dies suddenly while reading a book Joanna has never seen before, the sisters must reunite to preserve their family legacy.</p>

            <p class="description">Essun must pursue the wreckage of her family through a deadly, dying land. Without sunlight, clean water, or arable land, and with limited stockpiles of supplies, there will be war all across the Stillness: a battle royale of nations not for power or territory, but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night. Essun does not care if the world falls apart around her. She'll break it herself, if she must, to save her daughter.</p>

              <p class="description">An orphan’s life is harsh—and often short—in the mysterious island city of Camorr. But young Locke Lamora dodges death and slavery, becoming a thief under the tutelage of a gifted con artist. As leader of the band of light-fingered brothers known as the Gentleman Bastards, Locke is soon infamous, fooling even the underworld’s most feared ruler. But in the shadows lurks someone still more ambitious and deadly.</p>
